# Service36 — Repair Cases & Technical Notes
Apple-style minimal documentation from an independent repair lab in Voronezh, Russia.

---

## Overview
This repository contains the static GitHub Pages site for my repair case studies and engineering notes.

I’m **Denis**, independent Apple repair technician and owner of **Service36**.  
Since 2010 I work personally with iPhone, iPad and Mac diagnostics, display restoration (OCA), power issues, backglass replacement, micro-level repairs and board-level troubleshooting.

The goal of this repo is to keep a clean, structured archive of real-world repair data:
- concise repair cases  
- technical notes and measurements  
- repeatable diagnostics  
- cross-checked symptoms / causes / fixes  

Everything is written from hands-on practice — no marketing, no filler.
