title: "iPad mini 6: typical signs of a swollen battery"

## Symptoms

- The device **only works when the charger is connected**.
- It **shuts off instantly** when the cable is unplugged.
- The front glass is **slightly lifted on one side** (on mini 6 — usually on the left).
- Light pressure on the upper case feels “springy”.

In most cases this means the internal battery has expanded and started pushing against the display assembly.

## Power behaviour

- iPad mini 6 charges over USB-C using **Power Delivery**.
- In real use it draws **around 18–20 W**, even from a 30–60 W adapter.
- With a healthy battery the charging current is stable and predictable.

If the tablet:

- only charges with the screen off,  
- shows unstable power draw,  
- or shuts off immediately after disconnecting the cable —  

then the battery has likely degraded or swollen.

## Practical notes

- If the glass is cracked but the LCD is intact, the battery can usually be replaced **without mandatory display replacement**, assuming careful removal.
- The sooner the swollen cell is replaced, the higher the chance of saving the original screen.
