## Summary
An iPhone 13 arrives with a black screen but still boots, rings and vibrates. The device has a history of multiple GX hard OLED replacements, each panel failing after another drop. The final fix is to replace the hard OLED with an original pulled display and pair it through Apple Repair Assistant.

## Key symptoms
- device powers on, but the display shows no image  
- sounds, vibration and calls still work  
- several previous display replacements with GX hard OLED panels  
- screen failures consistently triggered by drops, not by spontaneous shutdowns  

## Diagnostics highlights
- confirmed that the logic board is alive by checking reactions to mute switch and incoming calls  
- identified a GX hard OLED panel and visible signs of a rebuilt device inside  
- verified the absence of obvious board damage or connector burn marks  
- interpreted the fault as a panel level issue, not a logic board failure, given the history and inspection  

## Technical notes
- hard OLED for iPhone 13 uses a rigid glass substrate, which is mechanically weaker under torsion and repeated drops  
- the front glass and frame can look intact while the OLED matrix is already cracked inside  
- rebuilt phones often combine non original housing, unpaired batteries and random hard OLED panels  
- an original pulled display with proper pairing via Apple Repair Assistant gives more predictable system behavior and a clean Parts and Service History  

## Practical conclusion
When a phone repeatedly kills hard OLED panels after minor drops, replacing them with yet another GX module is usually a dead end. For users who drop their device more than occasionally, a genuine pulled display is a more stable long term choice. Pairing the display in software is not just cosmetic, it makes future diagnostics easier and keeps the device history honest.
