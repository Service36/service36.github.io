## Summary
MacBook Pro A1708 units that sit unused for long periods may lose battery function. Swollen mid-cell packs can press on the trackpad and prevent normal charging.

## Key symptoms
- The laptop runs only on the charger and shuts down unplugged.
- A crossed-out battery icon appears at boot.
- Trackpad feels stiff or pushed from underneath.
- The device was stored for months or years without charging.

## Diagnostics highlights
- Confirm instant shutdown on power removal.
- Check trackpad mechanics for internal pressure.
- Open the bottom cover to visually confirm cell swelling.
- Verify stable charging behavior on a power meter after replacement.

## Technical notes
- Removing the trackpad first reduces risk during battery extraction.
- Controlled heating helps release strong adhesive under the cells.
- After install, monitor charge current, temperature, and full-charge stability.
- Deep storage at 0% accelerates cell degradation and swelling.

## Practical conclusion
For A1708, “works only on charger + stiff trackpad” is a strong indicator of battery swelling. A careful cell-by-cell replacement and post-repair charging verification usually restore normal autonomy.
