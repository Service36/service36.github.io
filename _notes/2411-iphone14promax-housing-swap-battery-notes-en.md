## Summary
For iPhone 14 Pro Max rear-glass damage, the real decision is not “glass vs no glass” but durability level. If the phone will face frequent drops, an original donor housing restores factory impact resistance. A genuine Apple battery moved from a donor should be finalized through Repair Assistant to keep Parts & Service History accurate.

## Key symptoms
- Rear glass shattered across a wide area after a drop.
- Loss of structural rigidity at the back panel.
- High probability of repeat impact in daily use.
- Owner request to refresh battery while the phone is open.

## Diagnostics highlights
- Verify frame geometry and display seating; any distortion favors full housing swap.
- Inspect donor housing: rear-glass condition and straight chassis matter more than cosmetic rail wear.
- For battery selection, check cycle count alongside health percentage; moderate-cycle genuine batteries age predictably.
- Plan for software pairing if a genuine battery is installed.

## Technical notes
- Stainless rails on iPhone 12–14 series scratch easily; cosmetic wear is typical and not a strength issue.
- Original donor housing restores factory stack-up, glass prep, and impact behavior better than aftermarket back glass.
- Repair Assistant (iOS 26.x) records the battery as Genuine/Used and prevents “Unknown Part” warnings when applicable.
- Proper adhesive restoration is critical to minimize dust ingress and maintain correct display pressure distribution.

## Practical conclusion
When durability is the top priority, an original housing swap is usually the most stable long-term fix. If a genuine donor battery is used, finishing the repair through Apple’s Repair Assistant keeps iOS reporting consistent and reduces future diagnostics noise.
